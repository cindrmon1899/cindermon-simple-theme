# Cindermon Simple Theme

> The official theme for cindermon.cf!

## Features: 

- Very minimalistic design, only using one single css file, and that's it.
- There's nothing really special with this theme, it is my poor attempt at being a web designer, and this tells that I need more practice rather than just changing the font to default monospace of your browser and putting a gray background that closely resembles dark mode, and a couple doodads like padding and stuff.. I still haven't done that much on anything but those things, especially with special markdown integration, so this is the most I can do for now.
- This is pretty much a work in progress, so please be kind to me ;-;

## How to install

- Just like most hugo themes, make a new hugo site through your terminal by typing `hugo new site <name_of_site_here>`, and then cd'ing into that folder, and do `git init`, so that you can do this command, which clones the theme onto your site:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/cindrmon1899/cindermon-simple-theme.git themes/cindermon-simple
```

- This creates a submodule that updates whenever I do a push and updates get directly to you, so you are always updated.

- But I dare you to even do that one, as this is highly experimental.

- Alternatively, you can just do a `git clone https://github.com/cindrmon1899/cindermon-simple-theme.git` and put it in your hugo site's themes folder.

- And don't forget to put `theme=cindermon-simple` onto your config.toml file, or else, it won't work.

- To update, just type `git submodule update --remote --merge`, especially when i updated something on my code.
